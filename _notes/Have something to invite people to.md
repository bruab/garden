It's way easier to [[Do outreach]] if you're not selling. Have something like a meetup, a podcast, an open source project, or a quest that new acquaintances can join if they'd like. (See [[Quests are better than pitches]].)

Taking the salesy-ness out of outreach makes it easier to [[Cultivate a connection with other beings]].

(This idea comes from [_Book Yourself Solid_](https://bookshop.org/p/books/book-yourself-solid-the-fastest-easiest-and-most-reliable-system-for-getting-more-clients-than-you-can-handle-even-if-you-hate-marketing-michael-port/12579873).)
