Not everything needs to get bigger, more efficient, more profitable. [[Harmony is better than growth]]. 

An optimized system can be harder to maintain, so leaving things in a Good Enough state is a way to [[Be kind to Future You]].

You have to [[Be careful when optimizing something you can easily measure]], because they're often not the things worth your attention. And if you find out that the most important things aren't amenable to measurement or optimization, the best policy might just be "optimize nothing."

(One probable exception: [[Optimize for discretionary time]].)
