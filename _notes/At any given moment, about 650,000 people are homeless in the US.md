Per the [US Department of Housing and Urban Development](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/2023-AHAR-Part-1.pdf):

> On a single night in 2023, roughly 653,100 people – or about 20 of every 10,000 people in the United States – were experiencing homelessness. Six in ten people were experiencing sheltered homelessness—that is, in an emergency shelter (ES), transitional housing (TH), or safe haven (SH) program—while the remaining four in ten were experiencing unsheltered homelessness in places not meant for human habitation.
