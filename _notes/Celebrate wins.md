Too much focus on future goals leaves too little room for appreciating the present moments, and past efforts that created it.

Too much focus on others' achievements will make you unhappy. (See [[Don't let social media make you miserable]]).

[[Make it easy to take notes]], note your wins, then revisit them regularly. 

(If you want to [[Be kind to Future You]], Present You has to accept kindness from Past You.)
