You'll always be consuming some, since [[Every place on earth has unsafe levels of plastic in the rainwater]].

But you can reduce your consumption, and you should, because at least according to one of the authors of the above-linked paper, this is a "dose makes the poison" situation.

Specifically, in [this podcast interview at 56:06](https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/episode/37-martin-scheringer), Martin Scheringer lists high-exposure products:

- _New cars_ - apparently that "new car smell" is endocrine-disrupting chemicals
- _New electronics_ - especially if you hold them to your face (see [[Put your phone away]])

These are good reasons to [[Buy stuff used]].

A couple more risky products:

- _Carpet_ - at least some newer, stain-resistant ones
- _Processed and packaged food_ - which is really hard to avoid! But a good reason to [[Grow your own food]]
