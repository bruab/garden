Because inflation. Because you've gotten better at what you do (inevitably, because you make it a point to [[Learn new shit]] and [[Seek flow states]]).

Because it's a way to [[Be kind to Future You]]. 

Raise your rates. Not as high as you possibly can—[[Don't try to optimize everything]], don't be afraid to [leave money on the table](https://briandavidhall.com/leaving-money-on-the-table/)—but raise them. 

And when someone pays your new rate without batting an eye, remember to [[Celebrate wins]].
