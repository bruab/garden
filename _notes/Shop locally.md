It's inexpensive to buy goods shipped here from halfway around the world, because [[Fossil fuel companies receive more than $5T a year in subsidies]].

But we all pay for it in environmental impact. Your grandkids will pay for it, too (if you have grandkids). [[Consider side effects]].

Beyond that: if you want to [[Avoid giving money to people, organizations, or causes you hate (if you can help it)]], it's easier to do when you know and share a community with the folks who produce the stuff you buy.

Buying locally can also be a way to [[Minimize your plastic consumption]].
