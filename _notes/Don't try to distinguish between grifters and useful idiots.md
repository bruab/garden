Focus instead on finding with other open-minded people and learning with them— in other words, [[Teach people shit]], [[Learn new shit]], [[Cultivate a connection with other beings]].

Trying to identify bad faith arguments is lose lose lose.

If you successfully identify a grifter, what has changed? You can judge them _even more harshly_ for their cynicism, but isn't it enough to judge them for their harmful words and actions?

If you successfully identify a useful idiot, what has changed? You can judge them _slightly less_ for their harmful words and actions. You can consider them redeemable and attempt to change their mind. Is that a good use of your energy?

If you _fail_ to determine for certain whether someone is a grifter or a useful idiot—and uncertainty is the most common outcome—you've simply wasted your time.
