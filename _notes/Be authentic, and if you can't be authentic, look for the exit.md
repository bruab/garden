Attempts to compromise on authenticity tend to lead to flailing, inconsistent attempts to make peace with a situation, followed by rebellion against it, followed by further failed attempts at compromise. (This characterizes, for example, my years of effort to "be on LinkedIn" before finally giving up in frustration.)

A waste of energy.

We have such short lives. Say what you think. If you're in a room with people who don't want to hear it, find another room.
