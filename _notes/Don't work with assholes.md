This is another way of saying [[Be authentic, and if you can't be authentic, look for the exit]], because interacting with assholes requires you to put up armor, all the time. It's a way to [[Be kind to Future You]], because the time spent dealing with assholes will wear on you, and impact your ability to [[Cultivate a connection with other beings]] (who aren't assholes).

Just as when you [[Minimize time and energy spent working for the Man]], you'll take a financial hit. It's worth it.
