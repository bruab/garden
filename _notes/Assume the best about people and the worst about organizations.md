It may be true that [1 in 20 people is a sociopath](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8374040/#:~:text=After%20calculating%20the%20conjoint%20mean,general%20adult%20population%20is%204.5%25.), but that means the other 19 aren't!

They would [probably help you in an emergency](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212420921005070), and if they sometimes act like jerks, well, most of us do. Sometimes.

Organizations, on the other hand, are good at evading responsibility and bad at nuance. They pursue crude goals like "grow revenue" and "persist" and aren't capable of perceiving you as a unique human being.

It may be [cheaper for them to poison you, get sued, and settle the lawsuit than to refrain from poisoning you in the first place](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-du-pont-lawsuit-west-virginia-idUSKBN15S18U) - and if it is cheaper, or even just _appears as though it might be cheaper_, it's what the organization will do.
