([Source](https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral/) - see Proposition 4.)

Once someone invents the plow, and unlocks the increased food production it affords, in the long term you have a choice between also adopting the plow, or being killed/displaced by those who have.

(Because increased food production --> fortifications to protect food surplus --> specialization as security force --> specialization as weapons maker --> army to maraud and enslave the simple folk living in the country.)

Candidly I don't _want_ this to be true, so at a minimum I want to understand the boundaries - what are (all) the possible exceptions?

Given [[Technology doesn't necessarily solve a real problem]], it's probably worth digging into the definition of "advantageous."

It seems to have a short time scale, since it's hard to [[Consider side effects]] of new technology, or even know them.

And it doesn't necessarily have to be advantageous to everyone - the plow creates "guy who owns the grain" and "guy who works the field." The former receives more of the advantage.
