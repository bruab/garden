This helps you [[Keep cost of living low]] and [[Minimize your plastic consumption]].

It reduces demand for new stuff, which in a perfect world would mean less resource extraction and pollution.

It's also a way to [[Avoid giving money to people, organizations, or causes you hate (if you can help it)]], since most of the default producers of most products are the same handful of shitty mega corporations.

(It's always possible that the guy who sells you used headphones on eBay might is a nazi, but it's okay to [[Assume the best about people and the worst about organizations]]).
