Of course there's such a thing as carrying capacity. It's unlikely that the earth can support 800 billion humans, especially if they all have dogs.

But we're not there yet. Taking the US as an example (because collecting and normalizing global statistics is hard):

- [[At any given moment, about 650,000 people are homeless in the US]] despite the fact that [[There are more than 16 million vacant homes in the US]]
- [[In the US, about 14 million households experience food insecurity each year]] despite the fact that [[The US wastes about 100 million tons of food each year]]

In other words, those who go without food and shelter do so despite the fact that we have at least an order of magnitude more food and shelter than they require.
