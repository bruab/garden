Obviously. Considering the alternative is "be one-dimensional."

This is a refinement and clarification on [[Be authentic, and if you can't be authentic, look for the exit]]: If you're only able to authentically share a handful of fragments of who you are, while keeping the rest out of sight ... that's not authenticity.

It's hard to contain multitudes, though. How do you [[Make your offer clear]] when you have so much to offer? If [[Harmony is better than growth]], what happens when the decision seems to be "share authentically and create disharmony, or don't and don't"?
