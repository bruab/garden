It's easy to get lost in list building, asset creation, research, process and automation ... and never actually talk to anyone. Which defeats the purpose of outreach.

Research is important! As a general rule, [[Don't reach out to someone until you've read at least three things they've written]].

But don't overthink or overplan. After 20 minutes of research, send off at least one message telling someone what you're up to, or asking a question. [[Start with friendlies]].

Getting feedback early and often is a way to [[Increase optionality]].
