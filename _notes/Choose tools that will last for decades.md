Not to save money, though choosing good tools will often mean [[Buy stuff used]].

Because over the course of the next few decades, you have the choice between spending time and energy evaluating, acquiring, learning, and honing new toolsâ€”or putting that same time and energy into mastering the one you've already chosen.

_Or_ you can just take that extra evaluation, acquisition, learning, and honing time _back_. See [[Optimize for discretionary time]].

It's fun to [[Try new shit]], and you deserve to have fun. But remember that [[Technology doesn't necessarily solve a real problem]]. If you're just having fun, carry on. But if you're trying to improve your work, or your experience of work, it's probably not a new tool you need. Instead: [[Seek flow states]] with the tools you have, or [[Go outside]].
