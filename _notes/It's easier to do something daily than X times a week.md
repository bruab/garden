... where X < 6.

Because it removes the overhead of having to decide whether to do the thing on a given day, and removes the room for negotiating with yourself ("Ehh it's only Wednesday, I'll do it tomorrow") that lets you tell yourself a story about how you meant well, and tried, and gosh darn it things just didn't work out. Not that you would ever tell yourself such a story, of course.

It's much simpler and much easier to aim for "every day" and remember [[80% is good enough (80% of the time)]] than to keep and check a calendar.

Here are some things that are good to do every day:

- [[Go outside]]
- [[Work out every day]]
- [[Seek flow states]]
- [[Put your phone away]]
- [[Learn new shit]]
- [[Do outreach]]
- [[Celebrate wins]]
