Do stuff where you have the option, but not the obligation, to act on the outcome.

Like:

- Tweet about what you're working on (you can decide whether / how to engage with replies)
- [[Say yes to every sales conversation]] (as long as you [[Enforce strong boundaries around communication]] you'll learn from it as a customer development conversation and may have the chance to [[Introduce friends to each other]])
