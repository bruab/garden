This is a digital garden, which (I think) means a collection of interlinked notes.

The best place to start is by clicking on one of these bullets. Maybe pick one that you disagree with:

- [[Don't pretend marketing funnels exist]]
- [[Don't trust research findings]]
- [[Optimize for word of mouth marketing]]
- [[Do outreach]]
- [[Use imperative statements]]
- [[Write for Future You]]

... then just click around.
