Similar how hard it is to accurately [[Consider side effects]] in practice, it's impossible to compensate for the impact of survivorship bias.

Even if you spent _all your waking moments_ consuming stories of failure you'd still be exposed to a disproportionate number of anecdotes, data, and spurious reasoning about how the successful got where they are.

"Actively and aggressively discounting all success stories as meaningless noise" sounds extreme, but it's the best you can do. (And it's still not enough.)
