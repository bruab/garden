You'll remember the things you were right about, because there are so many of them and you're living with the outcomes of those (right) choices every day ❤️

Some things I've been wrong about:

- "There will be violence at polling places in the 2020 election"
- "Student loan forgiveness will never happen"
- "I'll regret it if I stop using social media"
- "Recycling works and is a good thing to do" ([wrong](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/11/897692090/how-big-oil-misled-the-public-into-believing-plastic-would-be-recycled))
