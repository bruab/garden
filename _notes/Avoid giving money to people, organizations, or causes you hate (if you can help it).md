"There's no ethical consumption under capitalism" IDK maybe? But there's buying food from a company that underpays its workers while dumping chemicals into a river, and there's buying food from an organic, family-run market garden down the road.

One good way to do this is [[Grow your own food]].

This is also a reason to [[Shop locally]]. It's easier to know whether you hate a small, local shop than it is to untangle the politics and incentives at play with a multinational corporation. 

(Of course, [[Assume the best about people and the worst about organizations]].)
