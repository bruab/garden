There are plenty of therapies with low to no effectiveness, but even the more effective ones only work for some people, some of the time.

If you cut your and and worry it might get infected, know that [antibiotics won't help](https://www.thennt.com/nnt/antibiotics-for-hand-lacerations/).

If you're suffering from cardiac arrest, [Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medications](https://www.thennt.com/nnt/acls-medications-for-cardiac-arrest/) will not help. 

[Defibrillation will](https://www.thennt.com/nnt/defibrillation-for-cardiac-arrest/)! But it only helps 1 in 2.5 people - meaning 6 out of 10 receive no benefit.

[[Be skeptical of your data]] - a treatment that "saves lives" may only do so for a tiny fraction of patients, and may not be worthwhile after you [[Consider side effects]].
