Just to see what happens!

Maybe, like [eBay](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w20171/w20171.pdf), you'll find the answer is "not much."

Remember the [Parable of the Pizzeria](https://twitter.com/randfish/status/1562524666232979457) - are your ads creating new sales, or just claiming credit for sales that were already going to happen?

Give yourself a month to answer these questions:

- What's the true impact of eliminating paid advertising?
- How does this compare with the *claimed* ROI of my paid ads program?
- What would I do with my ads budget if I didn't need it?
