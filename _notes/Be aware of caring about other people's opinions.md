"Don't pay attention to what other people think" is probably good advice, but it's not going to happen.

The next best solution: focus on identifying moments when your mind wanders to opinions or statements from other humansâ€”real or imagined.

This awareness gives you the option to _selectively ignore opinions that don't serve you._ Or at least to try, and be gentle with yourself if you fail.
