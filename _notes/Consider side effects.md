Here's an example of a side effect: [[Every place on earth has unsafe levels of plastic in the rainwater]].

Seems bad. How do we do less of this?

When considering a change, especially a technological innovation, remembering that [[Technology doesn't necessarily solve a real problem]] is a start.

But even if it does solve a real problem, like "food sticking to cookware," there's no guarantee that the benefit will outweigh the negative side effects.

This is hard, because we only have to answer one question to determine if there's a benefit, but we have to answer infinite hypothetical questions to assess all the side effects.

The right amount of time to consider side effects is not "infinite" but it's also not "meh whatever we'll be fine." 

Default to non-adoption of technological innovations that solve non-critical problems. Revisit side effects of the tech you *do* use on a regular basis.
