A low cost of living is a way to [[Increase optionality]] since you won't urgently need to consume resources as they come your way. It makes it easier to [[Earn enough to save]].

It also requires that you avoid buying stuff mindlessly, encourages you to [[Buy stuff used]], and may even lead you to [[Grow your own food]] - all of which are good to do for reasons beyond saving money.
