It's a way to [[Be kind to Future You]]—you never have to remember where you put something, or waste money buying something you've already got, if everything has a home.

Giving everything a home will also help balance out any tendency toward hoarding—[[Harmony is better than growth]], even when it comes to the stuff in your house or the tools you use. (Speaking of which, [[Choose tools that will last for decades]].)

Of course, [[Don't try to optimize everything]]—have a junk drawer, a pile of planters in the corner of your yard, straw wrappers on your floorboard. Nobody (whose opinion matters) is judging you.
