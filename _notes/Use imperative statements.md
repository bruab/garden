Imperative statements are great.

As long as they're clear to the reader, they elicit at least two nearly-instant responses:

- Agreement / Disagreement
- Want to know more / Think I already know enough

TODO: 2x2 for "What reader will probably do and why"

Since you [[Write for Future You]], it's important to be unambiguous. For the sake of clarity (Future YOu is busy) and to make it easy to [[Keep track of things you change your mind about]]
